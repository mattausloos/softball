                    What happens when Team Allstate plays Team Milliman? The answer to that is Team Allstate ends up going to bed depressed. It was a horrific game for Team Allstate as they got crushed by Team Milliman once again. As Avery Goodman says “I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life. Keane can’t even get one hit? Are you fucking kidding me”. Jon Keane finished the day going 0-3. He did not record a hit. Game day manager Elijah Goodman had this to say on Keane’s performance “I will need to reevaluate who is hitting fourth next game”. It’s hard to put your finger on why Allstate struggles so much against this team but team catcher Jim Fuchs thinks it has something to do with them stealing signs. He said “Whenever I told Steve to throw an off speed pitch I heard someone in the dug out banging on the garbage bin”. The team has filed a complaint with the league and the league is looking into this. There were only two players on the team that did well offensively tonight and that is Team Owner KG who went 1 for 1 with a single and right center fielder Josh Serio who went 2 for 3. Josh Serio has been on a steady decline ever since he’s rookie break out season in 2019. Josh has since not lived up to his potential. When asked why, GM Bob ‘THE MOTHER FUCKING” Truth had this to say: “He’s overweight”. Obesity is a very serious issue in America that should not be taken lightly. Jason Fuchs had this to say, “Look at my body. Look at it. I work my ass off for this body. Fuck yes I do. Look at me. You like what you see baby?”. Jason works out 5 times a week and is in great shape, yet he has not hit a home run in his career. Team Allstate takes the field next week Thursday at 9:15 as they take on Team Charter. Also, Donny Baseball is hitting .143 this season.

                    The boys are back in town following their devastating 2020 playoff loss which left some teammates severely depressed. What's in store for us this season you ask? Well, there have been some managerial shifts this off season. 2020 season manager Elijah Goodman and 2020 team owner Kelly Goodman have both agreed to take on co manager positions for this 2021 season. Elijah will be the game day manager as Kelly will manage the non game day activities. Pathetic if you ask me. However, this change in responsibilites are proving to be not such a bad idea as Team Allstate secured the home opener win against Leff's Lucky Town with the final score of 18-11. The first inning was atrocious as SS Jon Keane committed 4 errors in the field resulting in the Lucky Town offense scoring 6 runs right away. "Here we go again", Allstate fans thought, "this team is washed up, why should we continue to show them support?". Allstate struck back with 2 runs in the bottom half of the inning, causing the momentum to lean towards their side. Allstate pitcher Steve Nelsen started to find a groove with his mechanics and was successful in hitting his spots limiting the Lucky Town hitters to only 2 runs in the second inning. The Allstate hitters lit a fire under their asses as they responded with 5 runs in the bottom half. Still down by 1 run, Nelsen continued to deal giving up only 2 runs in the top of the 3rd inning. At the bottom of the 3rd, Allstate hitters went back in hibernation mode as the offense achieved only a one bagger out of four at bats. Well, thank goodness that Nelsen gave up only 1 run in the top of the 4th as it setted up the Allstate hitters for a big fucking hit parade sparking the team's adrenaline rush that they haven't felt in years. The team scored 11 runs with 6 of them occuring during 2 outs. The Lucky Town team got scared and immediatley admitted defeat as they remained scoreless for the remainder of the game. Overall, it was a solid team effort that the boys should be proud of. Some notable performances were RC Jason Fuchs going 3-5, Elijah Goodman going 4-4 with a 3-run HR, P Steve "Babe Ruth" Nelsen going 3-4 with 2 RBI's and Rawr, rawr! Big Dawg Jon Keane going 4-4 with 4 RBI's. A key highlight of the day was Matty ice making his return from injury last season going 4-4 with 5 RBI's. "I'm a key contributor to the team despite what both managers say about me", Ausloos says. RC Jason Fuchs did not skip a beat with his feelings of arousal towards his teammates as they were triggered again during this game. "It peaked when cutie Matt Goetz made that nice spinning throw", Jason says. On the other end of the spectrum sits SS Jon Keane's thoughts as he stated "Josh Serio did not come to play. That's the only opinion I have on that game". Allstate game day manager Elijah Goodman doesn't care about the difference in his player's emotions as he states "I'm just proud of myself. 5-1 record as a game day manager. I am truly amazing".
