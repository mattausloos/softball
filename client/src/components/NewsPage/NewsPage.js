          OH NO!! We suck again. Team Allstate got a good ole ass kicking
          Thursday night as they lost 19-8 to team Pizza man. The team was short
          of their normal starters as LF Elijah Goodman was out with injury and
          SS Jon Keane and RC Josh Serio just didn't want to show up. Team
          Allstate managed to keep the game competitive early on as both teams
          went back and forth. But in the 5th inning, the Pizza Man offense
          decided to put an end to a sorry ass Allstate team by scoring 10 runs.
          The game was over from then on. Donny baseball went 0-3. He did not
          record a hit all night. The once dominate hitter looks to be in a
          steady decline having a lot of fans asking “Why is he even on the
          team?”. When asked if Donny would be on the roster next week owner
          Kelly Goodman said “I have no comment. We will be exploring all
          options out there and determine which one gives our team the best
          chance to win”. Kelly remained hot at the plate going 2-2 raising his
          season average to career highs. It is safe to say he has found the
          fountain of youth outside of pulling his groin running to second base.
          His son-in-law Samuel Botbol was seen inbetween innings intensely
          massaging Kelly’s groin hoping to get him back on the field but it
          didn’t work as he had to come out of the game. Matt Ausloos went 3-4,
          Avery went 3-4, Jason went 2-3, Matt Liewen went 2-4 with good efforts
          in the field and everyone else was horrible and or pathetic. Except
          Samuel who recorded his first hit in his first ever softball game.
          Congratulations to Sam! Team Allstate takes the field next Thursday.
          Hopefully they can win.

          Elijah Goodman is no longer elite. A few years ago when he came up to
          bat with the game on the line you knew he was going to win you the
          game. Not anymore. It’s a sad truth but the Elijah Goodman we once
          knew and loved is no more than a slightly above average player in the
          league. Jason Fuchs had this to say on his teammate, “Maybe he’s not
          as good as he use to be... but damn does he have nice glutes”. After
          falling to Team Charter 15-14 Team Allstate drops their season record
          to 2-2. They had their chances all game but could never get the big
          hit to put them over the top. They fell behind early thanks to
          horrific fielding from short stop Jon Keane and right center fielder
          Jason Fuchs. Jon Keane leads the team in errors and has been an
          embarrassment to the team on and off the field. Manager Kelly Goodman
          had this to say on the short stop, “What can I do? I didn’t think it
          was possible to be that bad. What the fuck can I do? If he would spend
          a little less time at bible study and a little more time practicing
          ground balls he might not be so bad”. Kelly Goodman is Jewish and has
          quote “No respect” for anyone who is not Jewish. Speaking of Jewish
          people Kelly’s younger brother Avery had a chance to win the game in
          the bottom of the 7th but failed miserably as he flew out to shallow
          right center field. Avery was seen after the game crying in the
          parking lot. Josh Serio hit his second home run of the season. Yes we
          are 4 games into the season and he just hit his 2nd home run. Can you
          say “PATHETIC”? Why has Josh been so bad this season and lacks the
          power he once had? Teammate Dennis Vavrik had this to say “I don’t
          like the kid, I never have liked the kid, and I never will like the
          kid”. Although that didn’t answer the question at all it does make you
          wonder why does Dennis hate Josh Serio? Unable to put our finger on it
          we asked members of Team Allstate for their insights. Jim Fuchs had
          this to say “All I know is they were messing around for a while last
          season then something happened and they won’t even speak to each other
          anymore. It sucks but that’s why I will never get romantically
          involved with anyone on the team”. Jim did say off the record that he
          did think Josh was a good looking young man and did in fact mess
          around with him on numerous occasions. Now let’s focus our attention
          back on the game. Josh Serio won himself player of the game going 2-3
          with a HR and 6 RBI’s. Kelly Goodman remained hot at the plate going
          3-3. Jon Keane (Christian) also went an impressive 3-3. Donny Baseball
          (Bartender) appeared to turn his season around going 3-4. Donny had
          this to say post game “It’s a joke I was hitting 8th in the lineup.
          Game day manager Elijah is a moron. I have no respect for him and am
          not surprised were on a 2 game losing streak with that idiot in charge
          of the lineup”. Jason Fuchs made up for his horrific fielding by going
          4-5 at the plate, proving he has what it takes to be an elite leadoff
          hitter in this league. Dennis Vavrik and Jim Fuchs continue to
          struggle at the plate but that is understandable given they can’t get
          Josh Serio out of their heads. Elijah and his uncle Avery had decent
          games and Matt Ausloos was a horrific 1-4. Team Allstate will take the
          field next Thursday as they look to snap their two game losing streak.

          What happens when Team Allstate plays Team Milliman? The answer to
          that is Team Allstate ends up going to bed depressed. It was a
          horrific game for Team Allstate as they got crushed by Team Milliman
          once again. As Avery Goodman says “I have never been so embarrassed in
          my entire life. Keane can’t even get one hit? Are you fucking kidding
          me”. Jon Keane finished the day going 0-3. He did not record a hit.
          Game day manager Elijah Goodman had this to say on Keane’s performance
          “I will need to reevaluate who is hitting fourth next game”. It’s hard
          to put your finger on why Allstate struggles so much against this team
          but team catcher Jim Fuchs thinks it has something to do with them
          stealing signs. He said “Whenever I told Steve to throw an off speed
          pitch I heard someone in the dug out banging on the garbage bin”. The
          team has filed a complaint with the league and the league is looking
          into this. There were only two players on the team that did well
          offensively tonight and that is Team Owner KG who went 1 for 1 with a
          single and right center fielder Josh Serio who went 2 for 3. Josh
          Serio has been on a steady decline ever since he’s rookie break out
          season in 2019. Josh has since not lived up to his potential. When
          asked why, GM Bob ‘THE MOTHER FUCKING” Truth had this to say: “He’s
          overweight”. Obesity is a very serious issue in America that should
          not be taken lightly. Jason Fuchs had this to say, “Look at my body.
          Look at it. I work my ass off for this body. Fuck yes I do. Look at
          me. You like what you see baby?”. Jason works out 5 times a week and
          is in great shape, yet he has not hit a home run in his career. Team
          Allstate takes the field next week Thursday at 9:15 as they take on
          Team Charter. Also, Donny Baseball is hitting .143 this season.

        <p style={{ marginTop: "30px", textAlign: "left", lineHeight: "24px" }}>
          The boys are back in town following their devastating 2020 playoff
          loss which left some teammates severely depressed. What's in store for
          us this season you ask? Well, there have been some managerial shifts
          this off season. 2020 season manager Elijah Goodman and 2020 team
          owner Kelly Goodman have both agreed to take on co manager positions
          for this 2021 season. Elijah will be the game day manager as Kelly
          will manage the non game day activities. Pathetic if you ask me.
          However, this change in responsibilites are proving to be not such a
          bad idea as Team Allstate secured the home opener win against Leff's
          Lucky Town with the final score of 18-11. The first inning was
          atrocious as SS Jon Keane committed 4 errors in the field resulting in
          the Lucky Town offense scoring 6 runs right away. "Here we go again",
          Allstate fans thought, "this team is washed up, why should we continue
          to show them support?". Allstate struck back with 2 runs in the bottom
          half of the inning, causing the momentum to lean towards their side.
          Allstate pitcher Steve Nelsen started to find a groove with his
          mechanics and was successful in hitting his spots limiting the Lucky
          Town hitters to only 2 runs in the second inning. The Allstate hitters
          lit a fire under their asses as they responded with 5 runs in the
          bottom half. Still down by 1 run, Nelsen continued to deal giving up
          only 2 runs in the top of the 3rd inning. At the bottom of the 3rd,
          Allstate hitters went back in hibernation mode as the offense achieved
          only a one bagger out of four at bats. Well, thank goodness that
          Nelsen gave up only 1 run in the top of the 4th as it setted up the
          Allstate hitters for a big fucking hit parade sparking the team's
          adrenaline rush that they haven't felt in years. The team scored 11
          runs with 6 of them occuring during 2 outs. The Lucky Town team got
          scared and immediatley admitted defeat as they remained scoreless for
          the remainder of the game. Overall, it was a solid team effort that
          the boys should be proud of. Some notable performances were RC Jason
          Fuchs going 3-5, Elijah Goodman going 4-4 with a 3-run HR, P Steve
          "Babe Ruth" Nelsen going 3-4 with 2 RBI's and Rawr, rawr! Big Dawg Jon
          Keane going 4-4 with 4 RBI's. A key highlight of the day was Matty ice
          making his return from injury last season going 4-4 with 5 RBI's. "I'm
          a key contributor to the team despite what both managers say about
          me", Ausloos says. RC Jason Fuchs did not skip a beat with his
          feelings of arousal towards his teammates as they were triggered again
          during this game. "It peaked when cutie Matt Goetz made that nice
          spinning throw", Jason says. On the other end of the spectrum sits SS
          Jon Keane's thoughts as he stated "Josh Serio did not come to play.
          That's the only opinion I have on that game". Allstate game day
          manager Elijah Goodman doesn't care about the difference in his
          player's emotions as he states "I'm just proud of myself. 5-1 record
          as a game day manager. I am truly amazing".
